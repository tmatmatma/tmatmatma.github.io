								<div class="footnote">I just kind of remember everyone who worked on this was really into it and there was this like jubilant quality to the way we were putting this together and there was no workplace drama just like a big group of people all excited about doing their part excited to see it come together.

								<p>(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/design-conference/">Launch site</a>) During the four years I worked at Bloomberg the magazine had put on an annual design conference in San Francisco. They were fun because we got to design every aspect of the event, from the decor of the venue, the video interstitials, down to the tiniest card detailing the guests’ wifi password.</p>
								<p>2016 was extra special because we had the designers of the magazine live-design the venue as “human singage”. We carried out a set of programmatic routines that mimiced the typographic animations on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/design-conference/">event website</a>.</p>
