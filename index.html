								<p>
									(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/06/style/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-wedding.html">Launch site</a>) Every possible question about Royal Wedding answered in a relic of an internet format<sup class="footnote-sup"></sup>.</p>
										<div class="footnote">Hot gos: this is a reprise of an earlier performance — a website I designed in 2016 for Matter Studios (R.I.P forever in <a href="https://matter-studios.github.io/">this repo</a> ), which was online for only about ... 2½ months. Everything deserves a second chance!!!!!!</div>
									<p>Each click<sup class="footnote-sup"></sup> a potential reward!</p>
										<div class="footnote">This project was also the perfect playground to learn JS, something I’ve struggled with for years and was super happy to finally get to experiment with in this safe infantile environment.</div>
									<p>Created in collaboration with LVL100 coder Umi Syam. Read more about the project at ItsNiceThat <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/the-new-york-times-style-magazine-the-royal-wedding-faq-digital-090418">here</a>.</p>

								<p>
									A handful of covers I designed over the years for the business publication. <span id="yahoo" class="spotlight">This one</span>, for a story describing Yahoo!’s last ditch effort<sup class="footnote-sup"></sup>, is my personal favorite.</p>
										<div class="footnote">At the time moment it began liquidating parts of the company after a long and unsuccessful attempt by then-CEO Marissa Mayer to restore the internet company back to its former glory. Mayer didn’t stay on for too long after this.</div>

									What I love about this is that the whole image<sup class="footnote-sup"></sup> is a riddle! </p>
										<div class="footnote">Loved using Arial and Times New Roman to create the specific L@@K.</div>

									It breaks away completely from the conventional formula of Headline ⇢ Image ⇢ Description<sup class="footnote-sup"></sup>.

								<div class="footnote">Powerful computer programming by Umi Syam.</div>
								<p>The restraint in the design and helps to surface the power of words and writing — its ability to articulate and to put feelings into focus, especially for events that are complicated and hard to make sense of.</p>
